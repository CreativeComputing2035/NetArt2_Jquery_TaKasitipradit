# NetArt2_Jquery_TaKasitipradit
As part of the Jquery exercise, I manipulated my initial "netArt" that I made using purely javascript to utilising jquery $(funtion).
It was very challenging to figure out how to use a jquery code to work like my initial javascript code from last assignment of using the "if statement."
In the end I tagle this exercise by wrapping my initial javascript code with jqeury function!
